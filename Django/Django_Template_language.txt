      v v v
STATICFILES_DIRS=[
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')  ##static is where our folders are present
] 

STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'assets')   ##assets is where django reads our files and keeps its folders
Now in order to create or to alert this assets folder give the following command
                  >>python manage.py collectstatic

Now we will get the assets folder where we have all css,js,images folders

Now whereever there is a hred=f change them like this ====>  "{% static ' link' %}"

And run the server ,now we will get the template as it is
